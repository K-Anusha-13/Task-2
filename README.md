# Task 2: Data Insertion and Handling Nulls

✅ **Objective:**
To practice SQL operations like inserting, updating, and deleting data while handling NULL values and using default values effectively.

🏥 **Project: Hospital Management Database**

📄 **Database contains the following tables:**
- Hospital – Stores hospital information
- Doctor – Stores doctor details and their associated hospital

   - Use of DEFAULT for patient phone number
3. Updated Records using UPDATE, including:
   - Filling missing data (e.g., phone numbers, notes)
   - Assigning foreign key values
4. Deleted Records using DELETE, including:
   - Removing cancelled appointments or patients
   - Cleaning up unassigned doctors
5. Displayed Data using SELECT * queries to verify changes.

📎 **Optional Attachments:**
- Screenshots of successful query execution/output
