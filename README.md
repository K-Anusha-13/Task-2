# Task 2: Data Insertion and Handling Nulls

✅ Objective:
To practice SQL operations like inserting, updating, and deleting data while handling NULL values and using default values effectively.

🏥 Project: Hospital Management Database

Database contains the following tables:
- Hospital – Stores hospital information
- Doctor – Stores doctor details and their associated hospital
- Patient – Stores patient records with optional phone info
- Appointment – Tracks appointments between doctors and patients

📌 What Was Done:
1. Created Tables using CREATE TABLE with relevant data types and foreign key constraints.
2. Inserted Data using INSERT INTO, including:
   - Rows with normal values
   - Rows with missing values using NULL
   - Use of DEFAULT for patient phone number
3. Updated Records using UPDATE, including:
   - Filling missing data (e.g., phone numbers, notes)
   - Assigning foreign key values
4. Deleted Records using DELETE, including:
   - Removing cancelled appointments or patients
   - Cleaning up unassigned doctors
5. Displayed Data using SELECT * queries to verify changes.

🖼️ Optional Attachments:
- Screenshots of successful query execution/output (if required)

📂 Tools Used:
- MySQL Workbench (for writing and executing SQL queries)

Files Included:
- task2_hospital.sql – Contains all SQL commands: CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT
- (Optional) Screenshot(s) for query results
